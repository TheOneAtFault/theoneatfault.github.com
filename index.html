				<h1>The top idea in your mind. - <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/top.html" target="_blank">Paul
						Graham</a></h1>
				<p style="color:#fff;">
					July 2010<br><br>I realized recently that what one thinks about in the shower in the
					morning is more important than I'd thought. I knew it was a good
					time to have ideas. Now I'd go further: now I'd say it's hard to
					do a really good job on anything you don't think about in the shower.<br><br>Everyone who's worked
					on difficult problems is probably familiar
					with the phenomenon of working hard to figure something out, failing,
					and then suddenly seeing the answer a bit later while doing something
					else. There's a kind of thinking you do without trying to. I'm
					increasingly convinced this type of thinking is not merely helpful
					in solving hard problems, but necessary. The tricky part is, you
					can only control it indirectly.
					<br><br>I think most people have one top idea in their mind at any given
					time. That's the idea their thoughts will drift toward when they're
					allowed to drift freely. And this idea will thus tend to get all
					the benefit of that type of thinking, while others are starved of
					it. Which means it's a disaster to let the wrong idea become the
					top one in your mind.<br><br>What made this clear to me was having an idea I didn't want as the
					top one in my mind for two long stretches.<br><br>I'd noticed startups got way less done when they
					started raising
					money, but it was not till we ourselves raised money that I understood
					why. The problem is not the actual time it takes to meet with
					investors. The problem is that once you start raising money, raising
					money becomes the top idea in your mind. That becomes what you
					think about when you take a shower in the morning. And that means
					other questions aren't.<br><br>I'd hated raising money when I was running Viaweb, but I'd forgotten
					why I hated it so much. When we raised money for Y Combinator, I
					remembered. Money matters are particularly likely to become the
					top idea in your mind. The reason is that they have to be. It's
					hard to get money. It's not the sort of thing that happens by
					default. It's not going to happen unless you let it become the
					thing you think about in the shower. And then you'll make little
					progress on anything else you'd rather be working on.
					<br><br>(I hear similar complaints from friends who are professors. Professors
					nowadays seem to have become professional fundraisers who do a
					little research on the side. It may be time to fix that.)<br><br>The reason this struck me so
					forcibly is that for most of the
					preceding 10 years I'd been able to think about what I wanted. So
					the contrast when I couldn't was sharp. But I don't think this
					problem is unique to me, because just about every startup I've seen
					grinds to a halt when they start raising money — or talking
					to acquirers.<br><br>You can't directly control where your thoughts drift. If you're
					controlling them, they're not drifting. But you can control them
					indirectly, by controlling what situations you let yourself get
					into. That has been the lesson for me: be careful what you let
					become critical to you. Try to get yourself into situations where
					the most urgent problems are ones you want to think about.<br><br>You don't have complete control,
					of course. An emergency could
					push other thoughts out of your head. But barring emergencies you
					have a good deal of indirect control over what becomes the top idea
					in your mind.<br><br>I've found there are two types of thoughts especially worth
					avoiding — thoughts like the Nile Perch in the way they push
					out more interesting ideas. One I've already mentioned: thoughts
					about money. Getting money is almost by definition an attention
					sink.
					The other is disputes. These too are engaging in the
					wrong way: they have the same velcro-like shape as genuinely
					interesting ideas, but without the substance. So avoid disputes
					if you want to get real work done.
					<br><br>Even Newton fell into this trap. After publishing his theory of
					colors in 1672 he found himself distracted by disputes for years,
					finally concluding that the only solution was to stop publishing:
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p style="color:#fff;">
						I see I have made myself a slave to Philosophy, but if I get free
						of Mr Linus's business I will resolutely bid adew to it eternally,
						excepting what I do for my privat satisfaction or leave to come
						out after me. For I see a man must either resolve to put out
						nothing new or become a slave to defend it.
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p style="color:#fff;">
					Linus and his students at Liege were among the more tenacious
					critics. Newton's biographer Westfall seems to feel he was
					overreacting:
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p style="color:#fff;">
						Recall that at the time he wrote, Newton's "slavery" consisted
						of five replies to Liege, totalling fourteen printed pages, over
						the course of a year.
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p style="color:#fff;">
					I'm more sympathetic to Newton. The problem was not the 14 pages,
					but the pain of having this stupid controversy constantly reintroduced
					as the top idea in a mind that wanted so eagerly to think about
					other things.</br></br>
					Turning the other cheek turns out to have selfish advantages.
					Someone who does you an injury hurts you twice: first by the injury
					itself, and second by taking up your time afterward thinking about
					it. If you learn to ignore injuries you can at least avoid the
					second half. I've found I can to some extent avoid thinking about
					nasty things people have done to me by telling myself: this doesn't
					deserve space in my head. I'm always delighted to find I've forgotten
					the details of disputes, because that means I hadn't been thinking
					about them. My wife thinks I'm more forgiving than she is, but my
					motives are purely selfish.</br></br>
					I suspect a lot of people aren't sure what's the top idea in their
					mind at any given time. I'm often mistaken about it. I tend to
					think it's the idea I'd want to be the top one, rather than the one
					that is. But it's easy to figure this out: just take a shower.
					What topic do your thoughts keep returning to? If it's not what
					you want to be thinking about, you may want to change something.</br></br>
